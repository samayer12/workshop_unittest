1. _Fast_
2. Focused (low-level) 
3. Developer-Written 

---

-> Audience Assumptions <-
===

* Familiar with Python
* Installed course resources
* Unfamiliar with testing
* Usually write simple scripts 

---

-> Why We Write Tests <-
===

* Focused feedback
* Ensure program behavior
* **Confidence**

---

-> How We Write Tests <-
===

1. *Arrange* the inputs
2. *Act* on the unit
3. *Assert* the outputs

-> Test Doubles Preview <- 
===

* *Dummy* - Ensure never used
* *Stub* - Read only 
* *Spy* - Write only
* *Fake* - Stub + Spy
* *Mock* - Self-verifying spy

-> What Unit Tests Are Not <-
===

* Wasted Developer Hours
* Panacea (cure-all)
* Defense against bad architecture
